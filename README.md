BinaryCalculator... v1 ... April 13 2017

This is a simple utility that converts decimal, binary, oct, hex and iEEE. It's named a calculator because eventualy I would like to incorporate calculator functions, + - * / different formats. I'll
worry about the name later. 

Currently conversions between all format except iEEE are working. 
Initially I only intended to handle all formats except iEEE. 
The iEEE conversions back and forth are incorrect, and the app 
crashes if you delete all the chars from the iEEE EditText.

I've designed and programmed format specific keypads. Each of them 
within the layout folder. The overall GUI look was just something I threw together as I was going. This encouraged me learn Material 
Design.

Cheers!
