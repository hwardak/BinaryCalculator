BinaryCalculator... v1 ... April 13 2017

This is a simple utility that converts decimal, binary, oct, hex and iEEE. 
Originally developed for use by my peer and myself during our computer science math courses.

I've designed and programmed format specific keypads. Each of them within the layout folder. The overall GUI look was just something I threw together as I was going. 

Further development will included arthmatic functions (+, -, /, x).

Cheers!
